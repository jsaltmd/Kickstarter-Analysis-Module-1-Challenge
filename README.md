### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## *Results*

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. *Based on the results, it can be concluded that most of the campaigns launched around the last two months of Q2 particularly the month of May has a high probability of success.*

2. *Campaigns when launched around Q1 and Q4 of the year have more chances of failing probably because these are the busiest months of the year. Refer to chart 3 below.*
